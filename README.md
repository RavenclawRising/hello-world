My name is Laura Duncan, and I have been an educator for about 30 years. As you can see by my user name I am a bit obsessed with the Harry Potter world. My other great obsessions are reading, dogs, and technology. I read on average about 125 books a year. This year I have already surpassed 100, so it will probably be closer to 200 books this year. As for dogs, I have seven, all are rescues or dogs that would have ended up as rescues had my family not adopted them. We also have two cats. All our animals get along fairly well. I use technology in my classroom almost everyday. I know HTML5 pretty well since HTML was my first programming language. I built my first websites in the early days of home computers, around 1997-1999. I coded my websites and designed most of the graphics I used on my sites. I started learning CSS in 2013, so I am fairly comfortable with using that as well, though I still have to look up things from time to time. Javascript was the third language I learned and is probably my weakest of the three. However, I have taught the basics to students in a few classes in the past. I love paying around with Ai and helping students use technological tools like Canva and Adobe Express to enhance their learning.
